# Pomato
(Created with Java in Android Studio, C# in Unity and Adobe Illustrator)   

A productivity app and game all in one. 
Pomato follows the pomodoro studying technique to allocate users both a 25min study session with a timer, 
  and a 5min break with a timed game. In implementing both features, Pomato hopes to encourage more users
  to be productive in an efficient and playful method. 
  
To note: Pomato is still a prototype created during the hackathon UofTHacks 2019, and has yet to combine both 
  mobile interface and game interface into one program. At the moment, they are two separate files tied together
  through the design's theme.
